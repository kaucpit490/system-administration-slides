- **Windows Server**:
  - Commonly used for running and testing .NET applications and Microsoft-specific products and services (e.g., Active Directory).
- **macOS** (on Mac mini hardware): Used for running and testing applications in cloud-based macOS environments.

---

## Unix and Linux History
- In 1969, a team at Bell Labs laboratories developed a new operating system named UNIX.
- UNIX was mostly found in large corporations and government environments due to licenses and cost issues.
- In 1991, Linus Torvalds in Helsinki, Finland, started working on a UNIX-like operating system that's free and open-source.
- A community of developers joined the effort and released version 1.0 of the Linux kernel with Torvalds in 1994.
- Today, Linus Torvalds and thousands of collaborators maintain the Linux kernel.
- A large community of developers maintain a large number of Linux distributions or distros, the Linux kernel with a collection of software packages.


---

## Linux and Unix Distributions

- Distribution = OS kernel + system tools + GUI (optional)
- Hundreds of distributions exist. Some community-driven and others enterprise-grade.

- **Linux Distributions**
  - **Debian:** One of the oldest Linux distro known for stability with minimal size.
  - **Ubuntu Server**: Debian-based known for ease of use and wide community support.
  - **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)**: Enterprise standard.
  - **Rocky Linux**: Free RHEL alternatives and replacement for the discontinued CentOS Linux distribution.

- **Unix Distributions/BSD Variants**

  - **FreeBSD**: Server environments security and stability focused.
  - **OpenBSD**: Security-first design
  - **NetBSD**: Highly portable across platforms

---

## Why Linux
<br>

- Within cloud computing and server environments, Linux is the operating system of choice for practical reasons:
  - Stable and always receives updates
  - Runs on a wide range of architecture
  - Low resource/hardware requirements
  - Uses Unix's modular design
    - Small programs that do one thing and can be combined to perform complex tasks.
  - Multi-user and multiprocessor support by design
  - Secure, permission-based file system.
  - Free and open-source

---

    - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution:** When you are done, make sure to delete the VM and all associated resources to avoid ongoing charges.

---

### Shell Types and Interfaces
- Linux has two basic interfaces:

1. **Command Line Interface (CLI)**:  
   - Command-line interface (black screen with text)
   - Lightweight and efficient
   - Default mode for servers and remote administration

2. **Graphical mode (GUI)**
   - User-friendly interface with windows, icons, and menus
   - Requires more system resources
   - Common desktop environments: GNOME, KDE

---

## Logging In
<br>

### Local Login (Terminal or GUI):
- Enter username and password

<br>

### Remote Login via SSH:

`ssh username@hostname`

- Authentication can be either of two methods:

  - **Password-based**: Prompted to enter your Linux user password (not secure)
  - **Public-Key Cryptography**: More secure; uses a public/private key pair.
    - You upload the public key into the remote Linux machine.
    - You keep the private key on your local machine.
    - Private key should be protected by a passphrase
    - SSH Key-pair are generated using the `ssh-keygen` command line tool.

---


## Generating SSH Key Pair for Authentication (I)

- You will generate SSH key pair
  - Public Key üîì: Copied to the server.
  - Private Key üîë: Stays on your computer.
- Private keys should be protected with a passphrase.

### Generating SSH Key Pair for Authentication (II)

- RSA:

```shell
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 
```

- ED25519:

```shell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```


---

### Generating SSH Key Pair for Authentication (III)

```shell
ssh-keygen -t rsa -m PEM -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/my-vm-key
```

```text   
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/khalidalharbi/.ssh/id_rsa): /Users/khalidAlharbi/.ssh/id_rsa_key
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /Users/khalidAlharbi/.ssh/id_rsa_key
Your public key has been saved in /Users/khalidAlharbi/.ssh/id_rsa_key.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:UJRVo82P9h0JVpnoN3ucIvgpzoqnZ+AI5BrHPej57pM khalidalharbi@MacBookAir
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 4096]----+

```

---

### Logging in using SSH key pair

<br>
<br>

- We can use the SSH client to establish a secure connection to the remote server:

```shell
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_key azureuser@20.173.96.68
```

  - `ssh`: The secure shell command for remote login
  - The `-i` flag specifies the path to your private key file.
  - `azureuser` is the username on the remote system
  - `20.173.96.68` is the IP address of the remote server 

---

### Powering Off and Shutdown
- The `shutdown` and `systemctl` commands can be used to power off the operating system gracefully.

- **Immediate shutdown**
```shell
shutdown -h now
# OR
systemctl poweroff
```

- **Scheduled shutdown**
```shell
shutdown -h +10 "System maintenance in 10 minutes"
```

- **Reboot**

```shell
shutdown -r now
systemctl reboot
```

- **Cancel scheduled shutdown**

```shell
shutdown -c
```

## The UNIX/Linux Filesystem
<br>

- The purpose of a filesystem is to organize the system's storage resources.
- Filesystem main components:
  1. **Namespace**: How to name things and organize them in a hierarchy
  2. **API**: a set of system calls for manipulating things
  3. **Security models**: schemes for protecting, hiding, and sharing things
  4. **Implementation**: software that talks to the underlying hardware

---

 ### Linux Filesystem Types

The Linux kernel supports several filesystem types:

**Native Linux Filesystems:**
- **_ext4_**: Default Linux filesystem with journaling and large volume support
- **_XFS_**: High-performance scalabile filesystem, optimized for large files and volumes
- **_Btrfs_ (B-tree Filesystem)**: Modern filesystem with snapshots and RAID support

**Non-Linux Filesystems:**
- **_FAT32_**: For USB drives and cross-platform compatibility. Can't handle files larger than 4GB.
- **_NTFS_**: Windows filesystem with permissions and encryption

---

### Pathname
- A pathname refers to the route to a unique location in the tree structure of the filesystem. The pathname can be described as:
  - **Absolute pathname**: starts with a slash on the left, e.g. /etc/passwd
  - **Relative pathname**: does not start with a slash. It's relative to the current working directory (pwd) e.g. etc/passwd

```bash
$ /home/khalid/scripts/bash/script.sh ## absolute pathname
$ cd /home/khalid/                    ## absolute pathname
$ scripts/bash/script.sh              ## relative pathname
```

---

### Special Directory References
- `.` (single dot): 
  - Refers to the current directory
  - Useful in relative paths (e.g., `./script.sh` runs script in current directory)

- `..` (double dot):
  - Refers to the parent directory
  - Used to navigate up directory levels (e.g., `cd ../..` moves up two levels)

---

### Mounting and Unmounting
- External storage media devices can be mounted in any directory created by the user.
  - Typically in `/mnt/`
- The `mount` command is used to mount a device and `umount` to unmount it.

```bash
$ mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
$ umount /mnt/cdrom
```

---

### Organization of the file tree
| Pathname        | Contents           |
| --------------- |--------------------|
|   /bin   and /sbin       |    Core Operating system commands.                |
|    /boot             |    Boot loader and files needed by the kernel.                |
|    /dev             |   Device entries for disks, printers, etc.                |
|     /home            |  Default home directories for users.                  |
| /root | The home directory for the root user (sometimes just /).  |



| Pathname        | Contents           |
| --------------- |--------------------|
|      /lib           |    Libraries, shared libraries, and commands used by /bin and /sbin
|   /mnt             | Temporarily mount points for removable media. |
|   /tmp              |     Temporarily files that disappear after reboot.               |
| /user | Hierarchy of secondary files and commands (/usr/bin, /usr/lib, etc.). |
| /var | System-specific data and configuration files. |


---

### File types (I)
- Linux uses a symbol to indicate the file-type.
- The symbol is the first 

```bash
$ ls -l
total 4
-rw-r--r--  1 khalid  staff    0 Sep 22 17:49 README.md
drwxr-xr-x  6 khalid  staff  204 Sep 22 16:59 content
drwxr-xr-x  4 khalid  staff  136 Aug 28 22:36 static
drwxr-xr-x  3 khalid  staff  102 Aug 28 22:36 themes
```

---

### File Types (II)
- You can view a file's type using the `ls -l` command (first character) or using the `file` command

| Symbol | File Type | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `-` | Regular file | Normal files like text, data, or executable programs |
| `d` | Directory | Contains references to other files and directories |
| `l` | Symbolic link | A special file that acts as a pointer/reference to another file or directory |
| `c` | Character device | Interface for character-oriented hardware, which handles data one byte at a time (e.g., terminals) |
| `b` | Block device | Interface for block-oriented hardware (e.g., disks), which handles data by block of bytes |
| `s` | Socket | Enables inter-process communication |
| `p` | Named pipe | Allows communication between processes without socket overhead |



---

### File Access Attributes (I)
- Every file has a set of nine bits called permission bits to control who can read, write, or execute the content of the file.
- The permissions are distributed into three user categories: user owner (_u_), users in the same group (_g_), and all other users (_o_).
- Permission bits are represented as either absolute (octal) or symbolic (character symbols).
- Each permission may for each of the three categories of users: owner, group, and other.
- Each of the three categories: owner, group, and others can have read, write, and execute permissions be turned 'on' or 'off'.
- File permissions are 4-digit
  - The first digit is optional and used for the special permission bits.
  - The second, third, and fourth digits are for the owner, group, and others.

---

### File Access Attributes (II)

- The "special bits" permissions are three extra permission settings: setuid, setgid, and sticky bit. 
- They are optional when using the `chmod` command
- They provide additional control beyond the standard read, write, and execute permissions

```
4  7  5  5
‚Üë  ‚Üë  ‚Üë  ‚Üë
|  |  |  +-- others (read and execute)
|  |  +----- group (read/write/execute)
|  +-------- owner (read)
+----------- special bits (setuid, setgid, sticky bit)
```


| Value | Bit        | Meaning                                     |
| ----- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 4     | setuid     | Run as file **owner**, not as calling user  |
| 2     | setgid     | Run as file **group**, or set group on dirs |
| 1     | sticky bit | Only owner can delete files in a directory  |


---

### File Access Attributes (III)

- In absolute mode, permissions are set using octal numbers, where each digit represents the combined read (4), write (2), and execute (1).


![File Permissions in absolute mode](/images/file-permission-bits.png)

---

### Inspecting File Permission Modes

```bash
ls -l my-script.sh
-rwxr-xr--  1 khalid  staff  0 Sep 22 17:49 my-script.sh
```

- There are read (_r_), write (_w_), and execute (_x_) permissions. 
- The symbol _-_ indicates the permission is turned off.

![](/images/ls-file-ownership-permissions.png)

---

## Absolute Permission modes
| Octal Value | File Permissions Set  | Meaning |
|--|----|-------------------------|
| 7| rwx| read, write, and execute|
| 6| rw-| read and write|
| 5| r-x| read and execute|
| 4| r--| read-only|
| 3| -wx| write and execute|
| 2| -w-| write only|
| 1| --x| execute only|
| 0| ---| none

---

### Changing permissions using `chmod` with an absolute mode

- Absolute Permission Modes:
```bash {class="large-code"}
# Everybody has full access:
chmod 777 main.java
# Owner has full access:
chmod 700 main.java
# Owner has full access, group members have read-only access:
chmod 740 main.java
```

---

### Changing permissions using `chmod` with a symbolic mode

- Symbolic Permission Modes:
  - Setting Permission using `=` will turn on the specified permissions and turn off all others.
```bash
# All users have read and write access:
chmod a=rw main.java
# User has read and write access:
chmod u=rwx main.java
# Group members have read access:
chmod g=r main.java
```

  - Adding or removing permissions using `+` or `-` will turn on the specified permissions and keep all others.

```bash
# Add the execute (x) permission to the user:
chmod u+x main.java
# Deny the execute (x) permission from the user:
chmod u-x main.java
```

---

### Changing file owner and group using chown

- The `chown` command is used to change file owner and group.
- `chown owner:group`
- The owner and group operands are both optional, however, one must be specified.  
- If the group operand is specified, it must be preceded by a colon (`:`) character.
- The `-R` option will recursively change the ownership of the directory and all its files and subdirectories.

```bash
# changing the owner of a file
sudo chown ali main.java 
# changing the owner of a directory
sudo chown ali ./src/
# changing the owner of a directory and its subdirectories
sudo chown -R ali ./src/
```

```bash
# changing the owner and group of a file
sudo chown root:staff main.java
# changing the owner and group of a directory
sudo chown root:staff ./src
# changing the owner and group of a directory and its subdirectories
sudo chown -R root:staff ./src/
```

### The UNIX/Linux Philosophy

<br>
<br>

### "Do One Thing and Do It Well"

<br>

> **"This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface."**
Doug McIlroy; E. N. Pinson; B. A. Tague, July 1978. "Unix Time-Sharing System: Foreword". The Bell System Technical Journal.


---

### Shell Types
- A shell is a user interface for accessing the operating system.
- Shells are either command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI).
- Text (CLI) shell types:
  - __sh__ the basic shell in UNIX-related environments.
  - __bash__ or Bourne Again shell: the standard shell for common users.
  - __zsh__ An extended Bourne shell with signifcant improvements.

---

### Common shell programs
- _ls_: lists the content of a directory
- _grep_: searches text
- _wc_: counts lines, words, and characters
- _sort_: sorts lines
- _uniq_: prints unique lines
- _head_: reads the beginning of a file
- _tail_: reads the end of a file

---

### Communication Channels
- Every process has at least three communication channels:
  - Standard Input (stdin)
  - Standard Output (stdout)
  - Standard Error (stderr)
- In most interactive text shells, stdin reads from keyboard, stdout and stderr writes outputs to the screen.
- These communication channels can be redirected into a file or piped into the stdin of another program or command.

---

### Redirection (I)
- Communication channels can be redirected into a file
- The symbols `<`, `>`, and `>>` are used to redirect a program's input or output to or from a file. 
  - _>_ Redirects stdout. It creates a file or replaces its content if it exists.
  - _>>_ Redirects stdout. It appends to the existing file's content.

```bash
# stdout to a file (create or replace)
ls /home > users.txt

# stdout to a file (create or append)
ls /home >> users.txt
```

---

### Redirection (II)

- The symbol _2>_ is used to redirect stderr into a file.

```bash
find /etc -name network 2> error.log
```

- Redirect stdout and stderr into two different files.

```bash
find /etc -name network > out.txt 2> error.log
```
  
  - _>_ sends stdout to a file named out.txt
  - _2>_ sends stderr to a file named error.log

---

### Pipes

- Pipes are used to connect the stdout of one command into the stdin of another command.
- Pipes use the pipe symbol _|_ 
- piping into _wc_ tool, which counts how many lines, words, and characters.

- Example 1: List how many users (including system accounts) are on a Linux system

```shell
cat /etc/passwd | wc -l
```

  - Example 2: List how many users on the system have Bash set as their login shell by using the search tool _grep_ and piping into _wc_.

```shell
grep bash /etc/passwd | wc -l
```

---

## Scripting and Automation

- It's important for a sysadmin to incorporate automation into your daily work.
- Automation is done through writing scripts.
- Whenever you encounter a repetitive task, automate it in a script.
- Examples:
  - Storing backups in two different data centers.
  - Checking if an application or a process has crashed accidently.
  - Creating, configuring, and deploying a cloud service in one command.

---

### From commands to script
- Scripts are plain text files containing shell commands
- These commands are exactly the same commands you run in a bash shell
- The script may also include control flow statements, loops, and functions.


--- 

## Bash Scripting Syntax

- Scripts start with a shebang: `#!/bin/bash`
  - It tells the system which shell interpreter to use when executing the script directly (e.g., `./script.sh`).
- Each command is written on a new line
- Variables are assigned without spaces: `name="value"`
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Do not use spaces before or after the `=` sign. Spaces are interpreted as command arguments, which will cause errors.
- Access variable values with the *\$*  symbol (e.g., `$name`)
- Comments start with `#`
- Use `echo` to print output
- Control flow: `if`, `for`, `while`, `case`
- Functions are defined with `function_name() { ... }`
- Scripts must be executable: `chmod +x script.sh`

---

### Bash Script Examples (I)

#### 1) Hello World Example

_script.sh_

```bash
#!/bin/bash
foo="HELLO WORLD!!!"
echo $foo
```

_Running/Execution:_


```bash
# make it executable
chmod u+x script.sh
# run it
./script.sh 
# or
bash ./script.sh
```

---

### Bash Script Examples (II)
<!-- .slide: style="text-align: left;"> --> 
2) Creating an archive (i.e., compressing a directory)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
target="/home/khalid/backup/archive.tar"
tar -cvf $target /home/khalid
```

3) Passing arguments to the bash script

_archive-maker.sh_
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "creating an archive file using tar -cvf $0 $1"
tar -cvf $0 $1
```

_Run it:_

```bash
bash ./archive-maker.sh output.tar /path/to/dir
```

---

### Reading Input

```bash
echo -n "Proceed? [y/n]: "
read ans
echo $ans
```

---

### Loops
- The _for ..in_ construct is used to perform loops/iteration.
- Example: copy shell script files (*.sh files) into a directory called _bin_.

```bash
srcDir=/home/khalid
targetDir=/home/khalid/bin
mkdir $targetDir
for scriptFile in $srcDir/*.sh; do
  echo "Moving $scriptFile into $targetDir"
  mv $scriptFile $targetDir
done
```

---

### Exercise (in-class activity)
- Modify the previous bash script to accept command line arguments instead of hard coded source and target path name values. Example:

```bash
bash move-sh-files.sh ~/ ~/bin
```

---

### Control Flow Statements

```bash
x=5
if [ $x -eq 5 ]
  then
  echo "$x equals 5"
elif [ $x -lt 5 ]
  then
  echo "$x is less than 5"
elif [ $x -gt 5 ]
  then
  echo "$x is greater than 5"
fi
```

---

### Functions (I)

- Declaring and calling bash functions

```bash
#!/bin/bash 
quit() {
  exit
}
hello() {
  echo Hello!
}
hello
quit
echo "End!"
```

### Functions (II)
- Passing parameters to a Bash function

```bash
#!/bin/bash 
my_function() {
  echo "In my_function"
  echo $1 $2 $3
  echo "End!"
}
my_function "Learn" "Bash" "Functions"
```

---

### Environment Variables: PATH and HOME (I)
- Bash uses certain global variables or environment variables. 
- Examples:
  - $PATH
    - Contains a colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for commands.
  - $HOME
    - Contains the path of the current user's home directory.

---

### Environment Variables (II)
- When you type a command you installed recently by its name and get an error message that says: "X: command not found", that means it's not available in your $PATH variable.
- If a command is not found, it usually means its location is not included in the `$PATH` variable.
- The full path name of commands must be added to your _$PATH_ environment variable.

---

### Environment Variables (III)

- You can set or update your `$PATH` in your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bashrc`, or `~/.zshrc`).
  - Append the path of your tool into the PATH variable.

```bash
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin:/path/to/mytool
export $PATH
```

- Save the file and login again or run the command: 

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Always append to the existing `$PATH` variable instead of replacing it. Do not set it directly, or you may lose access to essential system commands.

### Other Scripting Languages
- There're many general-purpose scripting languages that offer easy to read syntax and have an extensive set of standard libraries.
- Examples include Perl, Python, and Ruby.
- Python is a widely used scripting language for complex system administration tasks.
- System administrators are expected to be familiar with a language beyond Bash, such as Python to handle advanced automation and integration tasks.
